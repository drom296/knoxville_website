				Founded in 1786, Knoxville is the third-largest city in the U.S. 
				state of Tennessee, U.S.A., behind Memphis and Nashville, and is 
				the county seat of Knox County. It is the largest city in 
				East Tennessee, and the second-largest city (behind Pittsburgh) 
				in the Appalachia region. As of the 2000 United States Census, 
				Knoxville had a population of 173,890; the July 2007 
				estimated population was 183,546. Knoxville is the principal 
				city of the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area with a metro 
				population of 655,400, which is in turn the central component of 
				the Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette Combined Statistical Area 
				with 1,029,155 residents.
				<br /><br />

				Of Tennessee's four major cities, Knoxville is second oldest to 
				Nashville, which was founded seven years earlier. After 
				Tennessee's admission into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the 
				state's first capital, in which capacity it served until 1819, 
				when the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville 
				receiving the designation. The city was named in honor of the 
				first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.
				<br /><br />

				Knoxville was once also known as the Underwear Capital of the 
				World. In the 1930s, no fewer than 20 textile and clothing 
				mills operated in Knoxville, and the industry was the city's 
				largest employer. In the 1950s, the mills began to close, 
				causing an overall population loss of 10% by 1960.
				<br /><br />

				Knoxville is also the home of the University of Tennessee's 
				flagship campus. The university's sports teams, called the 
				"Volunteers" or "Vols", are extremely popular in the surrounding 
				area. In recognition of this popularity, the telephone area code 
				for Knox County and eight adjacent counties is 865 (VOL). 
				Knoxville is also the home of the Women's Basketball Hall of 
				Fame, almost entirely thanks to the popularity of Pat Summitt 
				and the University of Tennessee women's basketball team.
