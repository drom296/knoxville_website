				Before my co-op, I didn’t even know where Knoxville was, I kept 
				thinking it was in Texas for some reason. 
				<br /><br />

				Back in February of this year (2011), I was going through an 
				interview process with 
				<a href="http://www.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/">Scripps 
				Networks Interactive</a>. 
				There were two levels to the interview, second one hidden until 
				you pass the first, both of which were intimidating. The first 
				level of the interview was with the manager of the group, Ron.
				<br /><br />
				
				During the interview, Ron talked about a wide range of 
				technologies, most of which I didn’t know. With every question 
				about an unknown technology, my confidence level dropped. There 
				were some key points about the job that I thought made it the 
				perfect co-op experience.
				<br /><br />
				
				The position would be to work in a small team of 5 people 
				(better than my last co-op where I was a team of 1), using Java 
				as the main language (which I was taught year 1), and practicing 
				SCRUM methodologies. Using anything agile was the winning point. 
				I had been reading 
				<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/jtrap/the-agile-samurai">“The 
				Agile Samurai”</a> off the Programmatic Bookshelf. 
				<br /><br />
				
				Although I was able to answer some of the technical questions in 
				the interview, the conversation had gone well and I was told 
				about the second level of the interview process. Meet the Team.
				<br /><br />
				
				After my conversation with Ron, it was a few days until the next 
				step. I had time to prepare, and look up the tech that the team 
				used. Of course this was towards the end of a riguourous quarter 
				with lots to do (projects, hw), tons to prepare for (exams, 
				presentations), and very little time for leasure. As such, when 
				it came time to interview with the team, I had only learned a 
				tad more than I had known before. Better than nothing right?
				<br /><br />
				
				The second level of the interview process was completely 
				different than the first. There weren’t any real technical 
				questions, just very high level. Instead of being interviewed by 
				the 4 other team members, 15 people had showed up. It turned out 
				that they make interviews with potentials open to the 
				department for anyone to join and evaluate. 
				<br /><br />
				
				This interview was informal, and wasn’t about quizzing me on my 
				knowledge. Instead it was more to see if my personality would 
				<i>fit</i> with the team. After a couple of jokes, and a few laughs, 
				I had done well with the team and had received their approval. Two 
				days later, I had received my official offer to work with Scripps 
				Networks, and live in Knoxville for 6 months. Did I take it?
