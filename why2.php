				A 12 hour drive later, in a completely packed car, and I was in 
				Knoxville! 
				<br /><br />

				I had arrived a week prior to starting the co-op, with the 
				intent of soaking in some of the local culture. My primary goal 
				for this week: work on the southern accent.
				<br /><br />

				I had a misconception that since the job was in the south, to 
				fit in I should have a southern accent. I even started 
				practicing on the ride down. As such, I went around talking and 
				listening to as many people as I could. Although not perfect 
				(it was only a week after all), I had attained a weak southern 
				accent.
				<br /><br />

				First day on the job though, no one had an accent!
				<br /><br />

				Aside from that first day of disappoint, I met my team and I 
				started my journey in Knoxville. I learned a lot about team 
				dynamics, Agile methodologies, contractors and temp agencies 
				(80% of the employees were contractors). 
				<br /><br />

				I also did a lot of things I wouldnâ€™t have done elsewhere: learn 
				to ride a motorcycle, learn a couple of line dances, learn some 
				salsa moves, and even be comfortable with country music.
				<br /><br />
				
				Not to mention the fantastic weather of the south. It was a one 
				of those experiences that shapes your future.
