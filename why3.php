				Back in school mode, it was hard thinking back about what “free” 
				time was, but I do know I miss it. In Knoxville I had tons of it 
				after punch-out time, and made great use of it. I liked the 
				area, but I probably wouldn’t go back and live there 
				permanently.
				<br /><br />

				It did help put into perspective as to what I do like about a 
				particular environment. 
				<br /><br />

			It was great that their was scenic areas not too far from this city. 
			These made excellent motorcycle trips on the weekends.
			<br /><br />

			Since it was a moderately sized city, it had various venues of 
			entertainment. It had places to go at night, that were fun, safe, 
			and economic. It also had a bunch of places to go during day that 
			you could bring your family too.
			<br /><br />

			In terms of jobs though, it seemed that the tech jobs were limited 
			to a few companies. Therefore it would be hard to jump around and 
			find your niche. 
			<br /><br />

			There was also the part about natural disasters like, the intense 
			hail that was the size of ping pong balls, strong winds, and various 
			tornado warnings.
			<br /><br />

			Knoxville was a good stepping stone that helped me gain some insight 
			on what I should look for in the future. I took away some good and 
			bad experiences, that will influence the rest of my life, but I’m 
			glad I took the chance and went South for one of my co-ops.
