			<p class ="bubbleInfo">	Also known as Knoxville, TN, KnoxVegas 
				is the title given to this eastern TN city by its 
				young adult population. This is a play on words with 
				the similarities of 'vegas' and 'ville', and it adds to a notion
				of fun times to be had by its inhabitants. The sporting events, 
				arts/music scene, and bar life make this medium-sized city seem 
				more Vegas-like in its appeal.</p>
