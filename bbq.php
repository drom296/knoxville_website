			<h1>Bar-B-Que</h1>
			<p>
				BBQ was always the food to be had during the summer, but sadly 
				in the North only then as well. 
				<br />
				My favorite food was always BBQ, but I disliked that I could 
				only experience the smell of the grill during the summer season. 
				So when I was going to Knoxville for a co-op, I was euphoric 
				about the abundance of BBQ that was offered all year round. Here 
				are a few places I liked to eat at.

			<h2><a href="http://www.famousdaves.com/Knoxville">Famous Dave's</a></h2>

			<p>
				Where every server is famous! When your server comes up to you, 
				they normally would say: "Hi, welcome to Famous Daves, my name 
				is Famous Amy" or whatever there name was.
				<br /><br />

				You would then look over the menu, filled with various 
				Bar-B-Qued foods and off the went. At the table you would have 
				6 BBQ sauces, a roll of paper towels, and a mini-menu for desert 
				(ah bliss).
				<br /><br />

				The best part is that there is a special every day, and my 
				favorite was "Meal for Two Tuesday's".  A platter containing 
				various BBQ meats, and two sides (deliciousness).

		<div id="foodDead" class="item noFloat">
			<h2><a href="http://deadendbbq.com/">Dead End BBQ</a></h2>
			<img src="images/dead_end_bbq_small.jpg" alt="Dead End Island" />
			<p>
				A fine dining location that seems to cater more to the business 
				crowd. It's a tad more expense than Famous Dave's, and a little 
				bit off the main road, but it's definitely a "must-visit." BBQ 
				with some class!
				<br /><br />
				I've only had the pleasure of going once, via a welcome lunch, 
				but it was a great experience. I'm glad to have gone and 
				experience an "upscale" BBQ place, but I prefer going to the 
				homely pits. I feel it distracts to much from the BBQ.

			<h2><a href="http://www.coppercellar.com/Restaurant-Calhouns.html">Calhoun's</a></h2>
			<img src="images/calhouns.jpg" alt="Calhouns" />
			<p>
				Similar to Famous Dave's (without the table of awesomeness), 
				within a bigger building, with more seating, and a bigger menu.
				<br /><br />
				I think there are 3 separate locations, just in Knoxville. The 
				one that more well known, is the one by the river. I've gone to 
				the two on Kingston pike, and prefered the one with the silo.
