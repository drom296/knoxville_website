			<h2 class="bubbleHeader">Gatlinburg</h2>
			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				The main strip at least, is similar to Coney Island of New York. 
				Lots of shops to go through, mixed in with activities like 
				go-karts, makes for a good way to spend an afternoon.

			<h2 class="bubbleHeader">Ripley's Aquarium of The Smokies</h2>
			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				Smaller than expected but still filled with amazing things. 
				Families seem to flock here to go see the fish. One of the 
				amazing exhibits, outside of the penguins of course, was a 
				tunnel that went under the main bay, which you could walk 
				through.

			<h2 class="bubbleHeader">Motorcycle Trips</h2>
			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				Lots of routes to take, with plenty of scenic areas around. A 
				good one goes through the smokey mountains, which has plenty of 
				twists and turns. My longest trip was my intended route to 
				Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which ended up taking 11 hrs 
				(yikes!).

			<h2 class="bubbleHeader">Cotton Eyed Joe's</h2>
			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				Known for its line dances, and not just to country music. It 
				seems that many of the popular songs, have an associated line 
				dance. As such, in between the normal songs that allow people to 
				pair up and dance, they have group dances to particular songs. 
				Helps ease people onto the dance floor.

			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				Old City is located in the city's downtown area. Old City is an 
				offbeat urban neighborhood, home to several unique restaurants, 
				bars, clubs, and shops.

			<p class ="bubbleInfo">
				Salsa Dance company, which hosts various Latin parties and 
				weekly dance lessons. This is where I took my first dance class, 
				and thoroughly enjoyed. We learned to dance to salsa and bachata, 
				at various levels. During those 6 months, I started at beginner 
				and made it all the way to advanced.
